# MOOSE-BatModelling
A diffuse interface methodology for modelling interfacial voids in all-solid-state batteries utilizing MOOSE.

In this project, a diffuse interface model is proposed to simulate the concurrent evolution of interfacial voids and the negative electrode during the stripping and plating processes. The model is applied to a all-solid-state sodium (Na) metal battery with homogeneous and polycrystalline solid electrolyte (SE) separators.
